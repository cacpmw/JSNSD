# JSNSD

I decided I wanted to start getting certifications and the first one I am aiming for the (JSNSD)[https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/jsnsd/]
from Linux Foundation.

In this repo you will find all the exercises I am doing to prepare myself for the exam.
I setup a github project with the things I need to study in order to pass on the exam.
The tasks are divided by week and I plan to start Oct 10th 2024 and finish Nov 1st 2024.
By that time I hope to be able to take the exam.

# What I am using to study

I am using solely the book called Node Cookbook
